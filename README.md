# BMI CALCULATOR

I developed this responsive project using the React framework (or library...nobody knows). 

It's Body Mass Index calculator. 

The screen initially appears with the Header in fullscreen mode.
Then the BMI is calculated, and the Header shrinks to fit the screen along with the classification table. 

The BMI is highlighted in the table so that the user can see their classification.
